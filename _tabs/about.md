## 👋 Hello, I’m Omar
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/865334660448104449/1759008404/1500x500" alt="Omar" style="width:200px; border-radius:50%; display:block; margin:auto;" />
I’m a **Cybersecurity Specialist** and **Bug Bounty Hunter**, passionate about exploring security vulnerabilities and strengthening digital defenses.  

Before diving deep into security, I worked as a **Backend Developer**, building scalable web applications and learning how systems work from the inside out. That experience gave me a solid foundation in programming and architecture, which I now use to understand, exploit, and fix real-world security flaws.

## 🚀 What I Do
- 🔎 Hunt for security vulnerabilities and responsibly report them.  
- 🔐 Perform penetration testing and security assessments.  
- 🛠️ Develop tools and scripts to automate repetitive tasks.  
- 💻 Freelance projects in cybersecurity and web technologies.

## 🎯 Why I Love Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is not just a job for me — it’s a puzzle.  
I enjoy thinking like an attacker to protect like a defender. Each challenge is a new opportunity to grow, learn, and push beyond limits.

## 📚 Beyond Work
- I constantly explore new trends in **offensive security** and **defensive strategies**.  
- I share knowledge and insights through writing, discussions, and collaboration.  
- When I’m not in front of a screen, I enjoy **martial arts (MMA)** — which, in a way, teaches me the same principles: discipline, strategy, and resilience.
